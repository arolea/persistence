Eager fetching does not necessarily mean in a single query.
Dependencies are fetched before the entity is returned to the caller, not necessarily in a single query.

Entity states
New (Transient) - new entity, not mapped to a database row.
Once it becomes managed, the Persistence Context will issue an insert statement at flush-time.

Managed (Persistent) - entity associated with a database row and managed by the current running Persistence Context.
State changes are detected via dirty checking mechanism and propagated to the database as updates at flush-time.

Detached - when the persistent context closes, all managed entities become detached.
Successive changes will no longer be tracked, and no automatic database synchronization is going to happen.

Removed - entity is scheduled for deletion and the actual database delete statement is executed during flushing.

The Persistence Context captures entity state changes and during flushing translates them to SQL statements.
The JPA EntityManager and the Hibernate Session are gateways towards the underlying Persistence Context.
The Persistence Context is also known as the first-level cache and is not shared between transactions.
The second-level cache is associated with an EntityManagerFactory , and all Persistence Contexts have access to it.
The second-level cache has to use a clustered cache implementation if the application is distributed.
The Persistence Context has to be (manually) flushed before native queries in order to ensure consistency.
