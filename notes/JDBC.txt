JDBC defines the interfaces used for communicating with a database server.
JDBC implementations (Driver / DriverManager implementations) are specific for each database server.
To communicate with a database server, a Java program must obtain a Connection.
DataSource implementations are connection factories.
Since creating a Connection is an expensive operation connection pools should be used.
